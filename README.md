## Introduction
A TSQL analysis of some (presumably fictitious) sales data on Adidas product categories within the United States. We'll use the data to answer a few business tasks and provide recommendations.

* [Business Tasks and EDA](https://github.com/danny814/Adidas-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/adidas_business_tasks_and_eda.md)
* [Analysis-Based Recommendations](https://github.com/danny814/Adidas-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/adidas_recs.md)
* [Adidas Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset)

## Data Used
One dataset is used for this project:
* __adidas.csv__: Dataset containing invoice dates, units shipped, profit and profit margins, as well as some regional details. As we'll soon find out, the data is __very__ limited in certain aspects due to the volume that is missing. See the [full TSQL log](https://github.com/danny814/Adidas-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/proj_04_13.sql) for more info.
